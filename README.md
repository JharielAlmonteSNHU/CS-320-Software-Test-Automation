# CS-320-Software-Test-Automation

 - How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Based on my experience throughout this course, I believe the best way to ensure the functionality and quality of the code is through testing. Regardless of the    practice you chose, which is relative to the complexity or scope of the project, it is highly recommended to test the code in multiple scenarios, such as inserting invalid values if user input is needed.

-How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
 In the software development life cycle user’s needs and expectations are converted into user stories. These user stores are essentially the requirements to meet the user/costumer’s demand which are translated into code.
 
 -How do I approach designing software?
I prefer to design software based on the fundamental requirements to meet the expected result, while being mindful of the complexity and scope of these requirements. In more complex programs, I tend to rely on pseudo code to plan ahead of the development cycle.
